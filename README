PyMailingList is designed to meet a particular need that I had - a mailing list that will work with any mail server and will do the following:
1 - Allow arbitrary users to subscribe/unsubscribe the list via email
2 - Keep an archive of all discussions that is searchable from a website
3 - Prevent abuse by limiting email size

CONFIGURATION
	Configuration is done by modifying the config.example and copying it to config.txt. There are several options divided into sections:

	SERVER
	* hostname - The hostname of the server to connect to
	* port - The port on which to communicate
	* ssl - Whether or not to use SSL
	
	ACCOUNT
	* username - The username to use when logging in
	* password - The password to use when logging in
